# How to flash firmware via usb drive
1. Prepare a USB Flash Drive and format it to FAT32
2. Download a firmware and save it to root folder of USB Flash Drive (make sure are you rename it to Auto_Box_Update.img)
3. Connect box to a USB Wall Power Outlet/Charger. Wait for the solid red light. (You can use the USB port of car, but it's not recommended)
4. Insert the USB Flash Drive into box and wait at least 3-4 minutes while the device being updated (You will see alternative Red Light and Blue Light on the device and finally it stays Red)
